# H3
## Cells
The map is partitioned into hexagons.
This is done at multiple resolutions, where with each increasing resolution, a
hex cell occupies approximately 1/7th less surface area.

</div>

## k-Rings

A k-ring is any concentric ring around a cell.
The 1-ring is the ring of cells you can get to with one outward hop / traversal.
The 2-ring is the same, but for 2 hops. And so on.

For each location ingested, we use the H3 library to determine hex cells at
various resolutions, as well as the 1-ring and 2-ring at various resolutions.

## Resolutions
Lots of resolutions are [supported](https://h3geo.org/docs/core-library/restable):

| Resolution | Avg Hex Area               | Avg Hex Edge Length (km) | Number of unique indexes |
